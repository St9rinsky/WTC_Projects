# Problem set 1
on the coke.py problem, solving the task was a bit challenging
however breaking the problem into parts, first solving the insert coin, amount due arithmetic and the change
then followed by the unrocognised coins seemed to help solve the problem

# week 3
So far everthing from week 0 has been easy to do with my acquired knwledge, however things are getting a bit out o the confort zone but are still manageable. this could be the introduction of new concepts like the try statements, i did know about it but i had not used it in practice

* **try:try to do this one line**
* **except error: if i get an error do this**
* **else:only if the tried statement works do this**

if you put this statement in a true while loop you can repeat forever till we get the proper input, and breaking away from the loop.
it has come to my attention, wonder if its good practise however you can make a proper code an error like if you want only x>y but dont want x<y from user you can use an if statement together with the try statement

* **try: if x >= y : do something**
* ____**else: deliberate known error**
*  **except error: x smaller than y**

this ensures any value where x < y raises an error
