# my wethinkcode project
 
# Problem set 1
on the coke.py problem, solving the task was a bit challenging
however breaking the problem into parts, first solving the insert coin, amount due arithmetic and the change
then followed by the unrocognised coins seemed to help solve the problem

# week 3
So far everthing from week 0 has been easy to do with my acquired knwledge, however things are getting a bit out o the confort zone but are still manageable. this could be the introduction of new concepts like the try statements, i did know about it but i had not used it in practice

* **try:try to do this one line**
* **except error: if i get an error do this**
* **else:only if the tried statement works do this**
